This is a basic clock and calculator app that represents all numbers using base 12. The characters are designed after the ingenious Kaktovik Iñupiaq numerals, which were created by a group of middle schoolers in Kaktovik Alaska, to represent the base 20 counting system in Iñupiaq, their Inuit language. I take no credit for the design of the characters. I have merely co-opted the design for the development of this project because it is elegant and convenient to use for compound base number systems, and looks nothing like the Arabic numeral system.

The current functionality includes a clock, stopwatch, and timer, all of which run slower than normal time, as days are broken into 24 hours/day, 48 minutes/hour, and 48 seconds/minute. Also included is a calculator for doing math operations in base 12.

The number system is such that horizontal ticks on top represent multiples of four, and vertical ticks represent multiples of one. Decimal 11 is 2 horizontal ticks, and 3 vertical ticks. (8 + 3)

I had grander plans for this program, but once I got into the details of how to construct event handlers for the mouse, and discovered that singletons are not allowed in Processing, I decided to postpone this project indefinitely. I am currently learning Vulkan and C++, and I hope to do more UI stuff using that at some point in the future, so I will probably remake this project someday, but until then this is all there is.
